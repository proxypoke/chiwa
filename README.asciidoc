NAME
----
chiwa - change i3 wallpapers automatically.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program manages per-output wallpapers using i3's IPC interface, more
specifically by subscribing to the output event and reacting to changes. You can
configure a wallpaper for every output you use with a simple, JSON based
configuration file, or directly over the command line interface.
